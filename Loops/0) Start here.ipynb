    "## Python Loops - Questions and Answers\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook contains a set of questions and answers to help you understand Python loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. What is a loop in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** A loop is a programming construct in Python that allows you to repeat a block of code multiple times. It helps in automating repetitive tasks.\n"

    "### 2. What are the two main types of loops in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** The two main types of loops in Python are \"for\" loops and \"while\" loops.\n"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "### 3. How do you create a \"for\" loop in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** You can create a \"for\" loop using the `for` keyword, followed by a variable that iterates over a sequence (like a list), and a colon. The indented code block beneath the loop is executed for each iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for item in my_list:\n",
    "    # Code to execute for each item\n",
    "```\n"
   ]

   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "### 4. Explain the range function and how it's used in \"for\" loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** The `range()` function is used to generate a sequence of numbers. It's commonly used in \"for\" loops to specify the number of iterations. For example, `range(5)` would generate the sequence [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], and you can use it like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in range(5):\n",
    "    # Code to execute 5 times\n",
    "```\n"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "### 5. How do you create a \"while\" loop in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** You can create a \"while\" loop using the `while` keyword followed by a condition, and a colon. The indented code block beneath the loop is executed as long as the condition is `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "while condition:\n",
    "    # Code to execute while the condition is True\n",
    "```\n"
   ]
  },

   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "### 6. What's the key difference between \"for\" and \"while\" loops?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** \"For\" loops are used when you know the number of iterations in advance, while \"while\" loops are used when you want to repeat a block of code as long as a certain condition is `True`.\n"
   ]

    "### 7. Can you give an example of a \"for\" loop that prints numbers from 1 to 5?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in range(1, 6):\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "```\n"

    "### 8. Write a simple \"while\" loop that counts down from 5 to 1 and prints the numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "i = 5\n",
    "while i >= 1:\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "    i -= 1\n",
    "```\n"

    "### 9. What is an infinite loop, and how can you avoid it in your code?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** An infinite loop is a loop that continues to run without ever stopping. To avoid it, ensure that the loop condition eventually becomes `False` or use control structures like `break` statements.\n"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "### 10. How can loops be useful in solving real-world problems or automating tasks in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** Loops can be used to process large amounts of data, iterate through lists or dictionaries, perform repetitive calculations, and automate tasks like data processing, file handling, and more, making code more efficient and less repetitive.\n"
